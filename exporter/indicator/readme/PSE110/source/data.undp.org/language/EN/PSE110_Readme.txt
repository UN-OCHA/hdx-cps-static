This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

HDX methodology : GDP per capita based on purchasing power parity (PPP). PPP GDP is gross domestic product converted to international dollars using purchasing power parity rates. An international dollar has the same purchasing power over GDP as the U.S. dollar has in the United States. GDP at purchaser's prices is the sum of gross value added by all resident producers in the economy plus any product taxes and minus any subsidies not included in the value of the products. It is calculated without making deductions for depreciation of fabricated assets or for depletion and degradation of natural resources. Data are in constant 2005 international dollars.
