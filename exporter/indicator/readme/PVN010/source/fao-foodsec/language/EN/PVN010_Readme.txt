This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

HDX methodology : Estimated number of people at risk of undernourishment.
It is calculated by applying the estimated prevalence of undernourishment (see indicator V 7.1) to the total population (see indicator V_A1 in each period. Data for a 3-year period have been used for the estimation of the prevalence of undernourishment.

The reference periods are those periods for which data were available.

Baseline refers to 1993–95 for Former USSR Republics, Former Yugoslavian Republic and Former Czechoslovakia for proportion of undernourished and 1990-92 population-based for number of undernourished.

China, refers to China Mainland, Hong Kong SAR, Macao SAR and Taiwan Province.

Although not listed separately, provisional estimates for Afghanistan, Democratic Rep. of Congo, Iraq, Myanmar, Papua New Guinea and Somalia have been included in the relevant regional aggregates.

Eritrea and Ethiopia were not separate entities in 1990-1992 but estimates of the number and proportion of undernourished in the former Ethiopia PDR are included in regional and subregional aggregates for that period.

A dash (-) represents data less than 5%.
