This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.
More information is available at http://docs.hdx.rwlabs.org/

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

HDX methodology : (i) Countries outside the WHO African Region and low transmission countries in Africa.1 Estimates of the number of cases were made by adjusting the number of reported malaria cases for completeness of reporting, the likelihood that cases are parasitepositive, and the extent of health service use. The procedure, which is described in the World Malaria Report 2008 (16, 17), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness, likelihood that cases are parasite-positive) with those obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health service use. If data from more than one household survey was available for a country, estimates of health service use for intervening years were imputed by linear regression. If only one household survey was available, health service use was assumed to remain constant over time; analysis summarized in the World Malaria Report 2008 indicated that in countries with multiple surveys the percentage of fever cases treated in public sector facilities varies little over time. This procedure results in an estimate with wide uncertainty intervals around the point estimate.

 
(ii) Other countries in the WHO African Region. For some African countries the quality of surveillance data did not allow a convincing estimate to be made from the number of reported cases. For these countries, an estimate of the number of malaria cases was derived from an estimate of the number of people living at high, low or no risk of malaria. Malaria incidence rates for these populations are inferred from longitudinal studies of malaria incidence recorded in the published literature. Incidence rates are adjusted downward for populations living in urban settings and the expected impact of ITN and IRS programmes. The procedure was initially developed by the RBM Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group in 2004 (18) and also described in World Malaria Report 2008 (16, 17).
