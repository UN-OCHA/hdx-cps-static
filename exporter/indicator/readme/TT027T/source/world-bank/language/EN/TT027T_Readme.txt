This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

HDX methodology : The data used to estimate the international migrant stock at a particular time are obtained mainly from population censuses. The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.
