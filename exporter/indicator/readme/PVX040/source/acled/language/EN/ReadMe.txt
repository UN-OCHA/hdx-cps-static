This document is an extract of data compiled by automated extraction of data from a variety of online sources and manually compiled sources.
The compilation of data is performed on an ongong basis, generally once per day for the automated sources and less frequently for manually compiled sources.
The compilation is done by the Humanitarian Data Exchange (HDX), a project of the UN Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs.

Field Definitions
Source dataset : A unique identifier within HDX for the data source from which the information was obtained.
Indicator ID : A unique identifier within HDX for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  The Indicator ID is provided here to assist those who may be working with the HDX API to extract data from our databases.
Indicator name : A human-readable name for an indicator.  Indicators are something that can be measured and compared in a time series and applies to a country, crisis, or other entity.  
Units : The units of the indicator.
Dataset summary : A summary of how the indicator was compiled by the source.  This field contains information from the data source, and may contain commentary from the HDX team regarding the indicator. 
More info : A source of additional information about the indicator, generally from the organisation from which the indicator was obtained. 
Terms of use : The terms of use from the source of the indicator.  HDX cannot provide interpretation or further information about the terms of use.  Contact the source organization for such questions (see "more info").
HDX methodology : A description of any data processing performed by HDX in compiling the data.  If there is no information in this field, you can assume that the data has been pulled from the source using some form of script, has been validated against acceptable minimum and maxiumum values, and that the units have not changed from the source.  Additional processing will be described here.

Terms of use : If using ACLED data, please cite: Raleigh, Clionadh, Andrew Linke, HÃ¥vard Hegre and Joakim Karlsen. 2010. Introducing ACLED-Armed Conflict Location and Event Data. Journal of Peace Research 47(5) 1-10.
HDX methodology : The Armed Conflict Location and Event Database (ACLED) project codes reported information on the exact location, date, and other characteristics of politically violent events in unstable and warring states. ACLED focuses specifically on: 
- Tracking rebel, militia and government activity over time and space 
- Locating rebel group bases, headquarters, strongholds and presence 
- Distinguishing between territorial transfers of military control from governments 
to rebel groups and vice versa 
- Recording violent acts between militias 
- Collecting information on rioting and protesting 
- Non-violent events that are crucial to the dynamics of political violence (e.g. rallies, recruitment drives, peace talks, high-level arrests) 
ACLED data cover all countries on the African continent from 1997-present. Real-time data is available for African states. Data for additional countries including Haiti, Laos, Cambodia, Nepal, Myanmar are available from 1997-early 2010. Data for Afghanistan and Pakistan is available from 2006-2009 and Lebanon from 2006-2012.

Total number of incidents of all types are summed by country by year.  Non-violent incident categories are excluded from the sum.
