[© FAO] [Year of publication] [Title of content] [Page number (for publications)] [Location on FAO website] [Date accessed and/or downloaded]","Estimates of per capita food supplies available for human consumption during the reference period in terms of quantity, caloric value, protein and fat content. Calorie supplies are reported in kilocalories (1 calorie = 4.19 kilojoules). Per capita supplies in terms of product weight are derived from the total supplies available for human consumption (i.e. Food) by dividing the quantities of Food by the total population actually partaking of the food supplies during the reference period, i.e. the present in-area (de facto) population within the present geographical boundaries of the country. In other words, nationals living abroad during the reference period are excluded, but foreigners living in the country are included. Adjustments are made wherever possible for part-time presence or absence, such as temporary migrants, tourists and refugees supported by special schemes (if it has not been possible to allow for the amounts provided by such schemes under imports). In almost all cases, the population figures used are the mid-year estimates published by the United Nations Population Division. Per capita supply figures shown in the commodity balances therefore represent only the average supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what is actually consumed by individuals. Even if they are taken as approximation to per capita consumption, it is important to note that the amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown here, depending on the degree of losses of edible food and nutrients in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking etc. In many cases commodities are not consumed in the primary form in which they are presented in the commodity balance, e.g. cereals enter the household mainly in processed form like flour, meal, husked or milled rice. To take this fact into account, the caloric value, the protein and fat content shown against primary commodities in the commodity balances have been derived by applying the appropriate food composition factors to the quantities of the processed commodities and not by multiplying the quantities shown in the commodity balance with the food composition factors relating to primary commodities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2526.0,2461.0,2463.0,2448.0,2412.0,2313.0,2264.0,2136.0,2094.0,2054.0,1982.0,1993.0,1901.0,1855.0,1757.0,1691.0,1707.0,1596.0,1574.0,1506.0,1507.0,1613.0,1527.0,1593.0,1562.0,1602.0,1562.0,1524.0,1535.0,1503.0,1454.0,1435.0,1366.0,1438.0,1564.0,1617.0,1661.0,1690.0,1775.0,1685.0,1726.0,1707.0,1580.0,1705.0,1685.0,1612.0,1586.0,1565.0,1595.0,1645.0,1613.0,,,,,,,,,,,

Unpaid family workers who work for at least one hour should be included in the count of employment, although many countries use a higher hour limit in their definition.The labor force is the supply of labor available for producing goods and services in an economy. It includes people who are currently employed and people who are unemployed but seeking work as well as first-time job-seekers. Not everyone who works is included, however. Unpaid workers, family workers, and students are often omitted, and some countries do not count members of the armed forces. Labor force size tends to vary during the year as seasonal workers enter and leave. Usually active population is measured in relation to a long reference period such as a year, and the currently active population (labor force) is measured in relation to a short reference period such as one day or one week. Labor force statistics by gender is important to monitor gender disparities in employment patterns. Estimates of women in the labor force and employment are generally lower than those of men and are not comparable internationally, reflecting that demographic, social, legal, and cultural trends and norms determine whether women's activities are regarded as economic.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,26.7,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable. Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. For example, improved software was used to model the course of HIV epidemics and their impacts, making full use of information on HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The software explicitly includes the effect of antiretroviral therapy when calculating HIV incidence and models reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy, which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer. The software also allows for changes in urbanization over time - important because prevalence is higher in urban areas and because many countries have seen rapid urbanization over the past two decades. The estimates include plausible bounds, not shown in the Indicator data, which reflect the certainty associated with each of the estimates. The bounds are available at http://data.worldbank.org and from the original source.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,1.6,1.6,1.7,1.7,1.8,1.9,2.0,2.1,2.3,2.4,2.6,2.8,2.9,3.0,3.0,2.9,2.7,2.4,2.1,1.7,1.3,0.9,0.6,0.4,0.3,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The estimates are derived from the data on foreign-born population--people who have residence in one country but were born in another country. When data on the foreign-born population are not available, data on foreign population--that is, people who are citizens of a country other than the country in which they reside--are used as estimates. After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years. For countries with only one observation, estimates for the reference years were derived using rates of change in the migrant stock in the years preceding or following the single observation available. A model was used to estimate migrants for countries that had no data.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,13.6860998805807,,,,,14.20745958266,,,,,15.244567961521,,,,,15.8421925334225,,,,,20.7180925000509,,,,,15.8377472438105,,,,,22.3328239345075,,,,,12.9060309305935,,,,,13.4279469145158,,,,,13.8157494150292,,,,,14.0681046439332,,,,,,,,,,

Children under one year of age who have received a measles vaccine are estimated as the percentage of children aged 12–23 months who received at least one dose of measles vaccine any time before the survey or before the age of 12 months.

Measles-containing vaccines are live attenuated viral measles vaccines consisting of one dose given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route, with the opportunity for a second dose at least one month after the first.
