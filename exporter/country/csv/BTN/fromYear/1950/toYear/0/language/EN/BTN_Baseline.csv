The Gender Inequality Index is similar in method to the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). It can be interpreted as a percentage loss to potential human development due to shortfalls in the dimensions included. Since the Gender Inequality Index includes different dimensions than the HDI, it cannot be interpreted as a loss in HDI itself. Unlike the HDI, higher GII values indicate lower achievement. The world average score on the GII is 0.463, reflecting a percentage loss in achievement across the three dimensions due to gender inequality of 46.3%. Regional averages range from 28.0% in Europe and Central Asia, to nearly 58% in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the country level losses due to gender inequality range from 4.5% in the Netherlands, to 74.7% in Yemen.

This method is used for all countries outside the African Region and for countries within the African Region where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems and where malaria causes less than 5% of all deaths in children under 5 as described in the Global Burden of Disease 2004 update (19). A case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.45% is applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases for countries in the African Region and a CFR of 0.3% for P. falciparum cases in other Regions. In situations where the fraction of all deaths due to malaria is small, the use of a CFR in conjunction with estimates of case incidence was considered to provide a better guide to the levels of malaria mortality than attempts to estimate the fraction of deaths due to malaria.

 
(ii) Other countries in the WHO African Region, and Somalia and Sudan in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multi-cause model (VAMCM) developed by the WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) to estimate causes of death for children aged 1–59 months in countries with less than 80% of vital registration coverage. The VAMCM is a revised model based on work described elsewhere (20, 21). The VAMCM derives mortality estimates for malaria, as well as 7 other causes (pneumonia, diarrhea, congenital malformation, other neonatal causes, injury, meningitis, and other causes) using multinomial logistic regression methods to ensure that all 9 causes are estimated simultaneously with the total cause fraction summing to 1. The regression model is first constructed using the study-level data and then populated with year 2000–2010 country-level input data to provide time series estimates of causes of death in children aged 1–59 months. Deaths were retrospectively adjusted for coverage of ITNs and use of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. The bootstrap method was employed to estimate uncertainty intervals by re-sampling from the study-level data to estimate the distribution of the predicted percent of deaths due to each cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable. Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. For example, improved software was used to model the course of HIV epidemics and their impacts, making full use of information on HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The software explicitly includes the effect of antiretroviral therapy when calculating HIV incidence and models reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy, which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer. The software also allows for changes in urbanization over time - important because prevalence is higher in urban areas and because many countries have seen rapid urbanization over the past two decades.

Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.

","The proportion of 1 year-old children immunized against measles is the proportion of children under one year of age who have received at least one dose of measles-containing vaccine. 

Children under one year of age who have received a measles vaccine are estimated as the percentage of children aged 12–23 months who received at least one dose of measles vaccine any time before the survey or before the age of 12 months.

Measles-containing vaccines are live attenuated viral measles vaccines consisting of one dose given by the intramuscular or subcutaneous route, with the opportunity for a second dose at least one month after the first. It is generally recommended for children to be immunized against measles at the age of 9 months. In certain countries in Latin America and the Caribbean it is recommended for children to be immunized between the ages of 12 months and 15 months.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,94.0,95.0,95.0,95.0,94.0,99.0,95.0,90.0,93.0,87.0,88.0,78.0,78.0,78.0,77.0,71.0,84.0,85.0,85.0,81.0,84.0,86.0,89.0,93.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,
