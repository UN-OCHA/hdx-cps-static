The Gender Inequality Index is similar in method to the Inequality-adjusted Human Development Index (IHDI). It can be interpreted as a percentage loss to potential human development due to shortfalls in the dimensions included. Since the Gender Inequality Index includes different dimensions than the HDI, it cannot be interpreted as a loss in HDI itself. Unlike the HDI, higher GII values indicate lower achievement. The world average score on the GII is 0.463, reflecting a percentage loss in achievement across the three dimensions due to gender inequality of 46.3%. Regional averages range from 28.0% in Europe and Central Asia, to nearly 58% in Sub-Saharan Africa. At the country level losses due to gender inequality range from 4.5% in the Netherlands, to 74.7% in Yemen.

[© FAO] [Year of publication] [Title of content] [Page number (for publications)] [Location on FAO website] [Date accessed and/or downloaded]","Estimates of per capita food supplies available for human consumption during the reference period in terms of quantity, caloric value, protein and fat content. Calorie supplies are reported in kilocalories (1 calorie = 4.19 kilojoules). Per capita supplies in terms of product weight are derived from the total supplies available for human consumption (i.e. Food) by dividing the quantities of Food by the total population actually partaking of the food supplies during the reference period, i.e. the present in-area (de facto) population within the present geographical boundaries of the country. In other words, nationals living abroad during the reference period are excluded, but foreigners living in the country are included. Adjustments are made wherever possible for part-time presence or absence, such as temporary migrants, tourists and refugees supported by special schemes (if it has not been possible to allow for the amounts provided by such schemes under imports). In almost all cases, the population figures used are the mid-year estimates published by the United Nations Population Division. Per capita supply figures shown in the commodity balances therefore represent only the average supply available for the population as a whole and do not necessarily indicate what is actually consumed by individuals. Even if they are taken as approximation to per capita consumption, it is important to note that the amount of food actually consumed may be lower than the quantity shown here, depending on the degree of losses of edible food and nutrients in the household, e.g. during storage, in preparation and cooking etc. In many cases commodities are not consumed in the primary form in which they are presented in the commodity balance, e.g. cereals enter the household mainly in processed form like flour, meal, husked or milled rice. To take this fact into account, the caloric value, the protein and fat content shown against primary commodities in the commodity balances have been derived by applying the appropriate food composition factors to the quantities of the processed commodities and not by multiplying the quantities shown in the commodity balance with the food composition factors relating to primary commodities.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2828.0,2799.0,2785.0,2710.0,2724.0,2708.0,2753.0,2728.0,2618.0,2486.0,2451.0,2392.0,2516.0,2488.0,2638.0,2508.0,2382.0,2414.0,2405.0,2667.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The index ranges from 1 to 5, with a higher score representing better performance. Data are from Logistics Performance Index surveys conducted by the World Bank in partnership with academic and international institutions and private companies and individuals engaged in international logistics. 2009 round of surveys covered more than 5,000 country assessments by nearly 1,000 international freight forwarders. Respondents evaluate eight markets on six core dimensions on a scale from 1 (worst) to 5 (best). The markets are chosen based on the most important export and import markets of the respondent's country, random selection, and, for landlocked countries, neighboring countries that connect them with international markets. Scores for the six areas are averaged across all respondents and aggregated to a single score using principal components analysis.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,2.209336,,2.35,,2.62,,,2.35,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

The procedure, which is described in the World Malaria Report 2008 (16, 17), combines data reported by NMCPs (reported cases, reporting completeness, likelihood that cases are parasite-positive) with those obtained from nationally representative household surveys on health service use. If data from more than one household survey was available for a country, estimates of health service use for intervening years were imputed by linear regression. If only one household survey was available, health service use was assumed to remain constant over time; analysis summarized in the World Malaria Report 2008 indicated that in countries with multiple surveys the percentage of fever cases treated in public sector facilities varies little over time. This procedure results in an estimate with wide uncertainty intervals around the point estimate.

 
(ii) Other countries in the WHO African Region. For some African countries the quality of surveillance data did not allow a convincing estimate to be made from the number of reported cases. For these countries, an estimate of the number of malaria cases was derived from an estimate of the number of people living at high, low or no risk of malaria. Malaria incidence rates for these populations are inferred from longitudinal studies of malaria incidence recorded in the published literature. Incidence rates are adjusted downward for populations living in urban settings and the expected impact of ITN and IRS programmes. The procedure was initially developed by the RBM Monitoring and Evaluation Reference Group in 2004 (18) and also described in World Malaria Report 2008 (16, 17).

In no event shall the World Health Organization be liable for any damages arising from the use of the information linked to this section.,"(i) Countries outside the WHO African Region and low transmission countries in Africa.1 The number of deaths was estimated by multiplying the estimated number of P. falciparum malaria cases by a fixed case fatality rate for each country as described in the World Malaria Report 2008 (16). This method is used for all countries outside the African Region and for countries within the African Region where estimates of case incidence were derived from routine reporting systems and where malaria causes less than 5% of all deaths in children under 5 as described in the Global Burden of Disease 2004 update (19). A case fatality rate (CFR) of 0.45% is applied to the estimated number of P. falciparum cases for countries in the African Region and a CFR of 0.3% for P. falciparum cases in other Regions. In situations where the fraction of all deaths due to malaria is small, the use of a CFR in conjunction with estimates of case incidence was considered to provide a better guide to the levels of malaria mortality than attempts to estimate the fraction of deaths due to malaria.

 
(ii) Other countries in the WHO African Region, and Somalia and Sudan in the Eastern Mediterranean Region. Child malaria deaths were estimated using a verbal autopsy multi-cause model (VAMCM) developed by the WHO Child Health Epidemiology Reference Group (CHERG) to estimate causes of death for children aged 1–59 months in countries with less than 80% of vital registration coverage. The VAMCM is a revised model based on work described elsewhere (20, 21). The VAMCM derives mortality estimates for malaria, as well as 7 other causes (pneumonia, diarrhea, congenital malformation, other neonatal causes, injury, meningitis, and other causes) using multinomial logistic regression methods to ensure that all 9 causes are estimated simultaneously with the total cause fraction summing to 1. The regression model is first constructed using the study-level data and then populated with year 2000–2010 country-level input data to provide time series estimates of causes of death in children aged 1–59 months. Deaths were retrospectively adjusted for coverage of ITNs and use of Haemophilus influenzae type b vaccine. The bootstrap method was employed to estimate uncertainty intervals by re-sampling from the study-level data to estimate the distribution of the predicted percent of deaths due to each cause.",,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,0.0,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,,

They often disguise epidemics that are initially concentrated in certain localities or population groups and threaten to spill over into the wider population. In many developing countries most new infections occur in young adults, with young women especially vulnerable. Data on HIV are from the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS (UNAIDS). Changes in procedures and assumptions for estimating the data and better coordination with countries have resulted in improved estimates of HIV and AIDS. For example, improved software was used to model the course of HIV epidemics and their impacts, making full use of information on HIV prevalence trends from surveillance data as well as survey data. The software explicitly includes the effect of antiretroviral therapy when calculating HIV incidence and models reduced infectivity among people receiving antiretroviral therapy, which is having a larger impact on HIV prevalence and allowing HIV-positive people to live longer. The software also allows for changes in urbanization over time - important because prevalence is higher in urban areas and because many countries have seen rapid urbanization over the past two decades.

After the breakup of the Soviet Union in 1991 people living in one of the newly independent countries who were born in another were classified as international migrants. Estimates of migrant stock in the newly independent states from 1990 on are based on the 1989 census of the Soviet Union. For countries with information on the international migrant stock for at least two points in time, interpolation or extrapolation was used to estimate the international migrant stock on July 1 of the reference years.
